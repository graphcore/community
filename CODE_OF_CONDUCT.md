*	Feel free to interact with the developers and researchers from Graphcore, but if you need to report bugs or directly receive product support, please use our standard ticketing system or get in contact with our support engineers.
*	Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
